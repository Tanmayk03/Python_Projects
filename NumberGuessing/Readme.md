## 🎯 Number Guessing Game

Welcome to Day 7 of my Python learning journey!  
This is a simple yet fun Number Guessing Game where the player tries to guess the correct number between 1 and 100.

## 🕹️ Game Features

- 🎮 Two difficulty levels:
  - Easy Mode — 10 attempts

2. The game will secretly select a number between 1 and 100.
3. Enter your guesses — you’ll get hints if you’re too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you win or run out of attempts!
