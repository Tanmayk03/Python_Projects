# Python Turtle Project

A simple Python project using the Turtle graphics library.

## Description

This project demonstrates graphics programming using Python's built-in Turtle module.

## Getting Started

Quick steps to run this project locally.

1. Clone the repository
    - git clone <repo-url>
    - cd HirstColor

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    - Windows:
      ```
      python -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - macOS / Linux:
      ```
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. Install dependencies (none required for the Turtle example)
    - If a requirements file is added later:
      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. Run the project
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
    - The Turtle graphics window should open. If it closes immediately, ensure your script calls turtle.done() or keeps the window open.

5. Notes & troubleshooting
    - Use a local desktop environment (Turtle requires a GUI; it won't work on headless servers).
    - If you have multiple Python versions, use the appropriate python/python3 executable.
    - To exit, close the Turtle window or stop the script in your terminal/IDE.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages required (Turtle is built into Python)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the Python script:
```python
python main.py
```

## Features
